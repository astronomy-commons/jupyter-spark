**2. Render App Summary and log any Errors: Spark Applications Context**
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The widget pulls a small summary of Spark API that are running on various ports including information related to Application ID, Memory requirements, Enviroment Settings/Versions, Executor information etc. Also incorporated error handling if API fails for any reason!
<br /><br />

<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Icorporated forward-proxy all the inherited links to the extensionâ€™s base URI letting the IFramed on the extension itself.  
<br />
